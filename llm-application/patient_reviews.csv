hello everyone I receive this in my inbox this morning so I think I would share it with you all today scripture and whenever you stand pray if you have anything against anyone forgive he and let it drop leave it let it go in order that your father who is in heaven may also forgive youa mark 11 25 amp today word everyone have been hurt offend betray and mistreat at some point sometimes those wound are small and easy to move past but other time they are deep and take time to heal the important thing is that we choose to forgive so that we can open the door to goda s forgiveness and healing in our own life forgiveness is such a powerful tool forgiveness set you free and draw you close to your heavenly father one of the first thing my mother do when she find out that she have stage four cancer of the liver was to ask the lord to search her heart for any unforgiveness she didna t want anything to block her prayer for goda s healing and now more than twenty year later she still have a perfectly clean bill of health whenever you pray invite the lord to search your heart choose to forgive anyone that have hurt you as you walk in forgiveness youa ll experience his hand of blessing in way you never think possible and you will move forward in the abundant life he have in store for you prayer for today father in heaven I invite you to search my heart and mind I choose forgiveness so that I can receive your forgiveness in return I love you and bless you today in jesusa name amen

it was only one month after my husband 65th birthday that he was diagnose with pancreatic cancer it metastasize to his liver within 10 day after diagnosis so the prognosis go from an incurable disease to an incurable disease to much less time his will to live his passion for life in everything and a simple miracle give he one year and two week of life instead of the three to six month the doctor believe he endure many cycle of chemotherapy three different type of protocol and one phase I clinical trial during all of the time we spend in the hospital for test doctor appointment ctu unit and so on he was always joke and always tell everyone he would be this mother f ing disease it break my heart to hear and watch he at time but with a good poker face I think he think I believe he it was heart wrench to watch what he have to endure with the treatment and how hard he fight a battle with absolutely no amunition more like the first row of minuteman I learn today that a friend was diagnose with thyroid cancer cancer seem to be in style speak with she and she tell I it was an easy procedure remove the gland and that it she would go back in 10 year I hope so anyway I have been think a lot about what I would do if I were diagnose with one of those horrible disease I do not know whether I would have the strength or would want to put up the fight I do not know whether I would want to put my family through the fight with I sometimes I think that I would not let anyone know until the very end after get everye in order which by the way I am go to do as soon as all of my legal issue get resolve I am not sure if any of this make sense or if these thought are just because I feel so humble by life and have become such a realist or am I just obsess because my husband diagnosis was such a terrible shock have any of you have any of these thought

I am new to this site and the whole online support group thing in general I am pretty sure I have struggle with anxiety my whole life I remember as a kid I would get intense phobia about choke to death my parent literally could not get I to eat anything but water and a few bite of mashed potato for like 2 week so anxiety is definitely not something new to I I know I have it and was put on zoloft but do not last long on that because it make everything 100x bad was tell that it take a few week to kick in but I think I probably would have have a heart attack or jump off a bridge if I have to deal with the anxiety I was deal with while on zoloft for almost a year after that thing were good I only have a couple day a month where I was truly anxious my anxiety seem to come and go I will be fine for week or month and then have a bad about that seem to really get to I for about a week and then back to feel okay during my bad time I think every twinge ache pain itch and so on is cancer or something serious I have 2 amazing kid a very supportive husband other than the anxiety my life is almost picture perfect I guess what s bring I here now is that I have have wierd stomach pain that seem to come and go I have this problem awhile back and see my doctor who put I on a prescription for acid reflux and also order an abdominal ultrasound because he want to check for gallstone all come back negative for anything serious it seem like after I find out all was okay the symptom go away I honestly do not know if it was because of the med for acid reflux or the relief that there was not a tumor in there this was close to a year ago and the pain is back once again I am worry about liver cancer or pancreatic cancer or something really serious I keep tell myself that dwell on it and worry about it make it 10 x bad do anyone else think that because I am worry so much about it that I am create the pain myself it is so frustrating to think that my mind is create all of this
